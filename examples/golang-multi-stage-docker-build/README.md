In this session, we cover two critical concepts that help solve real-world containerization challenges: multi-stage Docker builds and distroless images. These techniques are especially useful in production environments and are frequently discussed in interviews.

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn

-Multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size and separate build-time dependencies from runtime.

-Distroless container images for enhanced security and performance.

-Practical example using a Go-based calculator application.

-Real-world implications in production and interview scenarios.

## 🧠 Concepts Explained

### 🏗️ Multi-Stage Docker Builds

-Traditional Docker builds often include unnecessary build-time dependencies in the final image (e.g., Ubuntu, curl, pip).

-Multi-stage builds split the Dockerfile into multiple FROM stages:

 -Stage 1 (Build Stage): Uses a rich base image (e.g., Ubuntu) to install packages, compile code, and generate binaries.

 -Stage 2 (Final Stage): Uses a minimal base image (e.g., Python runtime or distroless) and copies only the necessary binaries from Stage 1.

-This drastically reduces image size and keeps the runtime environment clean.


### 🛡️ Why Use Distroless Images?

Security: No shell, no package manager, and no extra tools reduce attack surface.

Minimal footprint: Contains only the application and essential runtime libraries.

Often used with languages like Go, Java, and Python for production builds.


### ✅ Summary

Use multi-stage builds to separate build and run environments.

Use distroless images to enhance security and reduce image size.

Combining both results in highly optimized, secure, and production-ready containers.
